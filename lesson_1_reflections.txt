1) How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
  In order to see the difference between two files you need to run the command:
    diff -u file1.js file 2.js
  You should put the older file first.

2) How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
    You would be able to work faster by not having to save multiple version each time you update.
    You can also quickly revert back to an older version if you make a mistake or find a major bug.
      This would allow your program to continue to run while you were making the changes to fix the issue.

3) What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

4) Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

5) How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

6) How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

7) Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
